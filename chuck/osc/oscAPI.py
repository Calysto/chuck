# simple API  for the Open SoundControl for Python (by Daniel Holth, Clinton
# McChesney --> pyKit.tar.gz file at http://wiretap.stetson.edu)
# Documentation at http://wiretap.stetson.edu/docs/pyKit/

# The main aim of this implementation is to provide with a simple way to deal
# with the OSC implementation that makes life easier to those who don't have
# understanding of sockets or programming. This would not be on your screen 
# without the help of Daniel Holth.
